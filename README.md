## Game Theme

- inspired from avatar -> fight your way to peace in a world of 4 elements
  - (air < fire < water < earth )
  - pick 1 element and fight until the end?
    - offer to change element at lvlup/mapup?
  - OR start with one element and master 4 elements through game
    - quests OR maps to master new element
    - defeat boss at the end
- Logo from 4 elements? && text logo T🔥r💧v🍃

## Game Design (GD)

- pokemon-rpg like, walking around and fighting enemies
- one map after the other
  - get enough xp, lvl up and choose when to reach next map
  - get rewards (more stats, stuff, attacks, items? )
  - no way back!
- lvl x gives acces to map x
- add a score screen at the game over

## Todo

> first release

- adapt enemies to theme avatar
- create element logic (water > fire etc.)
- add maps, enemies, attacks, items, stuff

- how to get new attacks? lvlup? map? chest? shop?

- map transition
  - add randomnes in rewards? (attacks, items, stuff, gems)
  - offer option to pick between average reward (5) or random (1-10)
- randomize the chests

- how to heal? => tarvern? pay? newMap?

> 0.0.X

- handle how is the game saved, loaded
  - start > new/load > world
- new > ask name > intro (dialog screen??) > world

- menu improve
  - options: (sound, save, load)
- fight system: state icons
- add AI logic (not only first attack)

- add visuals: player, enemies, maps,
- add sounds && music
- add story

- add randomnes => dmg, map rewards, chest, gems?, xp?
- world: game design? puzzle on some map?
- review map to move outside of screen?
- quests / achievements

## Ideas

- Starting a new map gives a random bonus for the rest of the run?
- think of system to make each game different: stuff to buy, stats to use, new attacks on map change etc.
- map enigmas?
