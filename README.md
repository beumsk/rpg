# RPG

## Game Design (GD):

- pokemon-rpg like, walking around and fighting enemies
- one map after the other
  - get enough xp and choose when to reach next map
  - no way back!
- lvl x gives acces to map x
- lvlup system:
  - enough xp > lvlup > access to next map + rewards (more stats, stuff, attacks, items? )
- add a score screen at the game over

## Todo:

- add maps, enemies, attacks, items

> 0.0.4

- stuff logic to improve: equip from menu && show if item equiped in menu
- add shop
- how to heal? => tarvern? pay? newMap?

> 0.0.X

- handle how is the game saved, laoded and reset
- menu improve
  - options: (sound, save, load)
  - menu stuff to equip?
- fight system: state icons
- add AI logic (not only first attack)

- add visuals: player, enemies, maps,
- add sounds && music
- add story

- add randomnes => dmg, gold?, xp?
- shops: items, attacks?, stuff? (pay with gold)
- world: add items on map and their collision + game design? puzzle on some map?
- quests / achievements

## Ideas

- Starting a new map gives a random bonus for the rest of the run?
- think of system to make each game different: stuff to buy, stats to use, new attacks on map change etc.
- map enigmas?
