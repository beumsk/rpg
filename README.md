## Game Design (GD):

- pokemon-rpg like, walking around and fighting enemies
- one map after the other
  - get enough xp and choose when to reach next map
  - no way back!
- lvl x gives acces to map x
- Starting a new map gives a random bonus for the rest of the run?
- map enigmas?

- lvlup system:
  - enough xp > lvlup > access to next map + rewards (more stats, stuff, attacks, items, )
- stuff logic to add
