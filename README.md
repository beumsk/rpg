# RPG

_desc_

## Game Design (GD):

- pokemon-rpg like, walking around and fighting enemies
- one map after the other
  - get enough xp and choose when to reach next map
  - no way back!
- lvl x === map x
- Starting a new map gives a random bonus for the rest of the run?
- map enigmas?

## Todo:

- review collision => maps have dead cells that a player/ennmy cant go on
- lvlup system: enough xp > lvlup > access to next map
- map system
- gold system: pay for items and stuff
- improve attacks to evolve with level
- how to heal? => tarvern? pay?
- add randomnes => dmg, gold?, xp?
- shops: items, attacks?, stuff?
- world: changing maps, add items on map, add collision
- menu: stats (lvl, xp, gold, win, str, hp), attacks, items, stuff, options(sound, save, load),
- fight system: state icons
- think of system to make each game different: stuff to buy, stats to use, new attacks on map change etc.
- add AI logic (not only first attack)
- quests / achievements??
- how is the game saved??
- add visuals: player, enemies, maps,
- add sounds && music
- add story
