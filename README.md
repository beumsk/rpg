# T🔥r💧v🍃

Tarava is an old school rpg inspired by my young years playing pokemon red. The story is based on the 4 elements: air, earth, water, fire. They are the base of everything on earth and our quest is to bring back freedom of the people by mastering the 4 elements and beat the evil masters.

## Game Theme

- inspired from avatar -> fight your way to peace in a world of 4 elements
  - air > earth > water > fire
    - 💨 erodes 🍃 > 🍃 absorbs 💧 > 💧 extinguishes 🔥 > 🔥 consumes 💨
  - pick 1 element and master 4 elements through game
    - quests OR maps to master new element
    - defeat master at the end
- Logo from 4 elements? && text logo T🔥r💧v🍃

## Game Design (GD)

- pokemon-rpg like, walking around and fighting enemies
- central map: doors to different element worlds
  - => go on the element of choice > finish the different maps (n, w, e, s) and final spirit to master x4 (elements)
    - you learn elemental attacks of world in rewards and get a thing showing we finished world
    - each map has monsters of any type to beat (+ quests?)
  - => master door opens > beat 4 masters + high master and win (OR spirit world??)
- Dmg = (dmg+str-def) x elmt(0.75|1|1.5)
  - => power up player/enemy with str and def
- Player lvlUp => dmg+20% & def+10% (& up attack | new attack?)
- Enemy lvlUp => dmg+20% & def+10%
- Items are in shop and rewards
- Stuff are in shop or rewards
- Attacks are in rewards andlvlup

## Todo

> first release

- add mobile support => touch instead of keyboard
  - move player, ...?
- test difficulty of game & add difficulty option?
- BUG with fight enter press, too many between attack and effect?
- graphics: colors, animations, transitions, backgrounds

> randomize

- rewardScreen => add boost? && option to pick average (5) or random (1-10) ?
- random dmg => attack have range of dmg

> other

- give enemies more attacks => should they have the same ones as player attacks?
- handle items curing malus

- new > ask name > intro (dialog screen??) > world

- focus button show more info (items, attacks, stuff, rewards)
- tutorial map??
- other player sprites to pick when starting
- fight system: state icons
- add AI logic (not only first attack)
- add time of play (+ paused when unfocus page?)
- panoplie boost??

- add visuals of items, stuff, attacks, fights...
- decorate the maps
- add sounds effects? => rewards, attacks, movements, clicks
- how to play on mobile?? => add move controls + clicks

- world: game design? puzzle on some map?
- quests / achievements

## Ideas

- save/load via download/upload file? (encrypt data to avoid cheat?)
- first fight intro+tuto against master that we lose as we only have basic attacks?
- quests in menu?
  - npc as deadSpots => when hitting => dialog screen? and start quest
- achievements in menu?
  - kill all kind of monsters, get all chest, stuff, attacks, elements
- flee a fight?
- map enigmas?
- review map to move outside of screen?
- each learned element would give a new monster to play? (pokemon like with switching monsters)
