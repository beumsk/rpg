Tarava is an old school rpg inspired by my young years playing pokemon red. The story is based on the 4 elements: air, earth, water, fire. They are the base of everything on earth and our quest is to bring back freedom of the people by mastering the 4 elements and beat the evil masters.

## Game Theme

- inspired from avatar -> fight your way to peace in a world of 4 elements
  - air > earth > water > fire
  - pick 1 element and master 4 elements through game
    - quests OR maps to master new element
    - defeat master at the end
- Logo from 4 elements? && text logo T🔥r💧v🍃

## Game Design (GD)

- pokemon-rpg like, walking around and fighting enemies
- central map: doors to different element worlds
  - => go on the element of choice > finish the different maps (n, w, e, s) and final spirit to master x4 (elements)
    - each map has monsters to beat (+ quests?)
  - => master door opens > beat 4 masters + high master and win (OR spirit world??)
- add a score screen at the game over

## Doc

### add doc about the files: screens, content

## Todo

- => review chest key system?

> first release: theme + element logic (fights) + story + randomize + graphics + sound + heal? + quests?

> randomize

- randomScreen => select random reward form chests, mapUp, lvlup
  - offer option to pick between average reward (5) or random (1-10) ??
- random dmg => attack have range of dmg
- random gems => gems collected are from range

> theme

- adapt enemies to theme avatar
- create element logic (water > fire etc.)
- add maps, enemies, attacks, items, stuff

> story

- story intro, new world texts, new element mastered, outro

> quests?

- quests in menu
- npc as deadSpots => when hitting => dialog screen? and start quest

> other

- how to get new attacks? => lvlup? map? chest? shop? quest? element?

- how to heal? => tarvern? pay? newMap?

- handle how is the game saved, loaded
  - start > new/load > world
- new > ask name > intro (dialog screen??) > world

- add helper window => info about menus, keys, goal
- menu options: sound, save, load
- fight system: state icons
- add AI logic (not only first attack)
- add time of play (+ paused when unfocus page?)

- add visuals: player, enemies, maps, => use sprites from online? (avatar, ff)
- add designs: floating clouds (japan style)
- add sounds && music
- add story

- add randomnes => dmg, map rewards, chest, gems?, xp?
- world: game design? puzzle on some map?
- quests / achievements

## Ideas

- first fight against master that we lose as we only have basic attacks?
- Starting a new map gives a random bonus for the rest of the run?
- think of system to make each game different: stuff to buy, stats to use, new attacks on map change etc.
- map enigmas?
- review map to move outside of screen?
- each learned element would give a new monster to play? (pokemon like with switching monsters)
